| Time | Visual | Dialog |
|------|--------|--------|
| 0:00 | **CAM** | "Two weeks ago, I deployed an AI agent that worked perfectly." |
| 0:03 | **CAM** | "It classified tickets. Drafted responses. Escalated when it should." |
| 0:07 | **CAM** | "In testing, it passed everything." |
| 0:09 | **CAM** — slight pause, let it land | "Seventy-two unit tests. All green." |
| 0:12 | **CAM** | "Then I pushed it to production." |
| 0:14 | **CAM** — shift energy, slower | "And it started costing forty dollars an hour." |
| 0:17 | **OVR** over **CAM** — Text: **$40/hr · No crash · No alert** | "No crash. No alert. No obvious failure." |
| 0:20 | **CAM** | "Just quiet, invisible drift." |
| 0:23 | **CAM** — direct to lens | "And I realized something uncomfortable." |
| 0:25 | **CAM** | "We've built agents that can reason." |

## VISUAL RHYTHM ANALYSIS

| Section | Camera | Screen | Overlay |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 0:00–0:55 (Beats 1-2) | 53s | 1s | 2s |
| 0:55–2:05 (Beats 3-4) | 8s | 58s | 4s |
| 2:05–2:53 (Beats 5-6) | 28s | 16s | 4s |
| 2:53–3:00 (End) | — | 7s | — |
| **TOTALS** | **89s (49%)** | **82s (46%)** | **10s (6%)** |

Roughly half camera, half screen. Good rhythm. Never more than 55 seconds of either before switching.

## ONE-PAGER USAGE

| One-Pager | Beat | Time on screen | What's visible |
|-----------|------|----------------|----------------|
| **The Hive Method** | Beat 5 | ~3s full + ~3s team zoom + ~3s workflow + ~3s metrics = **12s** | Principles, team, workflow, metrics bar |
| **THE JOURNEY** | Beat 5 | ~3s timeline strip | Build chronology |
| **What HiveBoard Sees** | — | Not used in v3 | *(available as backup if Beat 5 runs short)* |

**Total one-pager time: ~15 seconds in Beat 5**

## CRITICAL TIMING NOTES

**Beat 1 risk: 30 seconds before product.**
This is the biggest timing gamble. You're asking judges to listen to 55 seconds of story before they see the dashboard. It works IF your delivery has conviction and pace. Read Beats 1+2 aloud with a stopwatch. If you consistently land over 57 seconds, trim these lines from Beat 1:

> "It classified tickets. Drafted responses. Escalated when it should."

That saves ~4 seconds and the story still works — "deployed an agent that worked perfectly → seventy-two tests → production → forty dollars an hour" still lands.

**Beat 3 is the heart: 45 seconds.**
Don't rush. Let each click breathe. The timeline walkthrough is where judges go from "interesting" to "I want this." Give the failure node a full pause before clicking into it.

**Beat 5 pacing: 33 seconds for the Opus story.**
The one-pager visuals carry the weight here. When you say "450 checkpoints" and judges simultaneously SEE the metrics bar with that exact number, it's proof — not just claims.

## RECORDING ORDER

**Session 1: Screen recordings** (easiest to redo)
1. Dashboard — full continuous recording of: fleet view → click Sage → timeline walkthrough → failure detail → permalink → Cost Explorer. Do this 2-3 times. Pick the cleanest run.
2. One-pagers — open each HTML in browser full-screen. Record slow pans.
3. Docs site — quick scroll through sidebar.
4. Website — 2-sec capture of homepage.
5. GitHub README — 2-sec capture of top section.

**Session 2: On-camera** (multiple takes each)
1. Beat 1 (Story) — this sets the tone. Do 3-4 takes.
2. Beat 2 (Escalation through "This is HiveBoard") — 2-3 takes.
3. Beat 4 tail (the reframe: "Not better prompts... The problem was observability") — 2-3 takes.
4. Beat 5 (Claude as the Team) — the on-camera portions. 2-3 takes.
5. Beat 6 (Close) — the landing. Do 3-4 takes. This is the last thing judges hear.

**Session 3: Editing**
1. Assemble in beat order.
2. Drop in one-pager visuals during Beat 5.
3. Add text overlays (5 total — see OVR markers above).
4. Create end card.
5. Audio leveling.
6. **Stopwatch the final cut. Must be ≤ 3:00.**

## THE LINES THAT MATTER MOST

If you forget everything else, nail these:

1. *"Seventy-two unit tests. All green. Then I pushed it to production."* — Beat 1
2. *"This is HiveBoard."* — Beat 2 (the reveal)
3. *"Fifteen seconds from question to root cause. That's what supervision looks like."* — Beat 3
4. *"The problem wasn't intelligence. The problem was observability."* — Beat 4
5. *"Claude wasn't assisting development. It was the development team."* — Beat 5
6. *"We've built agents that can think. Now we need systems that can see."* — Beat 6
