 I see a lot of founders still building websites the same way they did ten years ago. But if they don't adapt, they'll loose customers. Here's why: The best converting websites in the age of AI aren't websites at all. They're the product. Historically, websites were marketing billboards. Hero sections, feature lists, testimonials, pricing tables. You'd scroll for minutes just to understand what a product does. That made sense when attention was cheap and patience was abundant. But in the age of AI, that's no longer good enough. People are crazy impatient these days. If they don't see value in the first five seconds, they're gone. They don't want to read about what your product can do, they want to experience it. That's the new default. And it has massive implications for how we design landing pages and conversion flows. Take most SaaS websites as an example. Landing on a typical site today means reading walls of text, watching explainer videos, filling out demo request forms. A lot of friction... Now, imagine an AI-native flow: You land on the page with a specific problem. The product is right there, live and interactive. You start using it immediately and see real value in seconds. Sure, you still need to sign up to save your work, but everything else just happens. I'm pretty sure the traditional marketing website is becoming obsolete. Once people expect instant interaction, they won't tolerate passive content. Letting users explore your product immediately builds infinitely more trust than any hero section ever could. And once they've experienced the value, upselling becomes so much easier. People are no longer buying a promise but something they've already used. I think one of the early growth factors for Lovable was exactly this. We doubled down on the "instant value" approach. You land on the site and just start building. The product teaches you how to use it by using it. And most AI companies are doing it this way now btw: Midjourney, ChatGPT, Google. Even ElevenLabs does it. Shows instant value by demonstrating the product. My prediction is that every company will eventually transform their website into an "agent hub." You'll land on a page with a specific problem. An AI agent greets you and asks what you need. The agent starts working immediately, generating your design, analyzing your data, writing your content. You see real results in seconds. Then, to save or export, you sign up. If I were to start a company today and design a new website, here's what I would do: I'd think about the single biggest pain point and why users are coming to me. Then, I wouldn't try to sell them a solution, but show them one. Let them interact with one. Make them fall in love with it. The best websites won't explain what they do. They'll just do it.
