Let me study the full prototype thoroughly before making design decisions.Now I have the full picture. Let me design and build the v3 prototype.



\*\*Design decisions:\*\*

\- \*\*Top bar view toggle\*\*: "Mission Control" | "Cost Explorer" — swaps the center panel

\- \*\*Agent Detail mode\*\*: Clicking an agent transforms the center panel into an agent detail view with tabs (Tasks, Pipeline, Metrics) — click the "×" or deselect to return

\- \*\*Hive cards\*\*: Enriched with queue depth badge, issue indicator, processing status

\- \*\*Timeline\*\*: LLM call nodes get distinct rendering, plan progress bar above

\- \*\*Stream\*\*: Rich pipeline events with kind-aware icons
