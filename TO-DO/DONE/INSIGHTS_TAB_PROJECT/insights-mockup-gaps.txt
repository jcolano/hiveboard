   What the Mockup Gets Right

  Structural alignment is excellent. The mockup faithfully implements the spec's four-section layout (Glance,
  Investigation, Optimization, Review) with all 38 questions represented. Specific wins:

  - Section collapse/expand matches spec Section 4.2 — chevron toggle, localStorage-ready pattern
  - Toolbar has the correct three controls (Range, Agent, Refresh) per spec Section 4.1, defaulting to 24h
  - Q1 Fleet Status Bar — colored segments proportional to agent count, exactly as specced
  - Q2 Attention Badge — red pill with itemized breakdown
  - Q4 Mini-Charts — inline SVG sparklines with trend arrows in a 4-column grid, matching spec Section 13's "inline SVG,
   no library" decision
  - Q7 Heartbeat — uses the horizontal bar showing age vs threshold, consistent with spec
  - Q10-Q16 — correctly implemented as a Recent Tasks Table with "View Timeline" links, not re-implementing the timeline
  - Q18 Model Efficiency — table has $/1K Tok column matching the revised spec (post-audit fix #14), not the old
  task-success-rate approach
  - Q20 Prompt Bloat — threshold text says "ratio >10 AND tokens_in >5,000", matching audit fix #12
  - Q35 ROI Calculator — has input fields + "Copy as Text" button, matching audit fix #16
  - Q37 Health Gauge — SVG donut with score/100, penalty breakdown below
  - Q38 Scale Readiness — checklist with pass/fail icons and verdict banner
  - Smart Detectors — all 6 present (Q22-Q28) with the consistent card pattern from spec Section 6
  - CSS variables reuse the same design tokens as the main dashboard

  Gaps Between Mockup and Spec

  1. Missing accessibility attributes (Spec Section 14)

  The mockup has zero ARIA attributes. Per spec:

  ┌─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │     Element     │                      Missing                       │
  ├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Section headers │ role="button", aria-expanded, aria-controls        │
  ├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Gauge SVG       │ role="img", aria-label="Fleet health score: 72..." │
  ├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Status badges   │ role="status", aria-label                          │
  ├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Trend arrows    │ aria-label="Improving: up 2.1%..."                 │
  └─────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  The toggleSection() function also doesn't respond to Enter/Space keypresses — it only has onclick.

  2. No empty states or error states (Spec Section 8.5)

  Every card shows populated data. The spec requires defined empty states (e.g., "No agents registered yet" for Q1, "No
  cost data in this range" for Q17) and error states (failed API card with retry button). A production mockup should
  show at least one example of each.

  3. Investigation agent selector doesn't show cross-section navigation (Spec #19 fix)

  The mockup has the agent selector bar with "Click any agent name above to auto-select" hint text, which is good. But
  the stuck agent link in Q3 (Investigate →) doesn't wire to selectInsightsAgent() — it's just a static .nav-link. The
  spec calls for clicking agent names in Glance to auto-scroll and pre-select in Investigation.

  4. Q9 issue filtering text

  The mockup shows an issue with (×6) occurrence count and a "Recurring" badge, which is correct visually. But the card
  doesn't indicate the filtering logic. The spec (post-audit fix #6) requires action not in ('resolved',) — meaning
  dismissed issues should also appear. The mockup only shows one issue so this isn't testable, but worth noting for the
  implementation.

  5. Q19 Cost Timeline lacks hover tooltip

  The spec says: "Hover tooltip: timestamp, cost, calls, tokens_in, tokens_out." The mockup renders the SVG chart and
  spike marker statically with no tooltip mechanism. The shared tooltip pattern from spec Section 13.3 (#insightsTooltip
   element) isn't present.

  6. Q32 Deploy Comparison — source attribution is good

  The mockup's footer says "Based on agent_version changes in registration events" — this matches the audit fix #18
  (detect deploys from agent_registered events). Nice detail.

  7. Q34 chart data direction seems inverted

  The spec says cost/task trending down is good (green). The mockup shows the line going from $0.09 down to $0.06 with ↓
   18% cheaper in green, which is correct. But the SVG polyline visually goes from top-left (y=25, lower = more
  expensive since SVG y-axis is inverted) to bottom-right (y=44, higher = cheaper). The visual slope suggests cost is
  rising, while the numbers say it's falling. The y-axis labels confirm: $0.09 (left/start) → $0.06 (right/end). This is
   a visual inconsistency — the SVG y-coordinates need to be inverted so the line slopes downward to match the "cheaper"
   narrative.

  8. WebSocket integration not represented

  The spec (Section 8.6) defines a window.hiveBoardEvents hook for real-time updates. The mockup's Q5 Activity Feed has
  a static "LIVE" badge but no WS plumbing. This is fine for a static HTML mockup — just noting it for the
  implementation bridge.

  9. Differential refresh not represented

  Spec Section 8.7 defines fast (15s) vs slow (60s) refresh tiers. The mockup shows "Updated 3s ago" in the toolbar but
  doesn't distinguish refresh speeds. Again, expected for a static mockup.

  10. insights-card-qid is a nice addition not in the spec

  The mockup adds a small Q1, Q2, etc. label in the top-right corner of each card. This isn't in the spec but is a great
   UX feature — it directly ties each card to the 38-questions document, making auditing trivial. Recommend adding this
  to the spec.

  Design Quality Observations

  The mockup is production-quality HTML/CSS. A few standout design choices:

  - .section-moment-tag (e.g., "~2 seconds", "~10-15 min") — elegant touch that sets user expectations per section
  - .detector-ok / .detector-warn / .detector-error border-left coloring — provides instant visual scanning of detector
  status
  - .investigation-agent-bar with accent tinting — clearly separates the per-agent context from the global cards
  - ROI Calculator layout with 4-column result grid is clean and stakeholder-friendly
  - Consistent typography — IBM Plex Mono for data, Plus Jakarta Sans for labels — matches the main dashboard

  Recommendations

  1. Add to the spec: the Q# card label pattern (insights-card-qid) — it's too useful to leave undocumented
  2. Fix Q34 SVG: invert the y-coordinates so the visual line slopes downward (matching "cheaper")
  3. Add one empty state example: e.g., show Q8 Queue as "Queue is empty" with green badge for the second agent
  4. Add ARIA attributes: at minimum on section headers and the gauge — this is low effort in the HTML
  5. Add keyboard handler to toggleSection(): listen for keydown with Enter/Space

  Overall the mockup is an excellent implementation of the spec. The visual fidelity is high and it correctly
  incorporates most of the audit fixes. The main gaps are accessibility and interactive behaviors (tooltips,
  cross-section navigation) which are expected to come in the JavaScript implementation phase.

✻ Brewed for 57s

❯ Regarding the gaps, could those be due to this being a mockup? should the mockup include these gaps already? or
  that would be for the produciotn version?

● You're right to question that. Let me sort the gaps by what's reasonable to expect in a mockup vs what belongs in
  production code only.

   Belongs in production only (not the mockup's job)

  - #5 Hover tooltips — requires JavaScript event handlers, pointless in static HTML
  - #8 WebSocket integration — runtime plumbing, impossible to mock statically
  - #9 Differential refresh — runtime behavior
  - #3 Cross-section navigation wiring — the mockup already has the hint text ("Click any agent name above to
  auto-select") and the "Investigate" link in Q3, which is the right level of fidelity for a mockup. The actual
  selectInsightsAgent() function is implementation work
  - #4 Q9 filtering logic — internal processing logic, invisible in a mockup


Missing in the mockup that need to be added while creating production

- #1 ARIA attributes — these are just HTML attributes, take 10 minutes to add, and they establish the pattern for
  implementers to follow. If the mockup omits them, the production code almost certainly will too. At minimum:
  role="button" + aria-expanded on section headers, and role="img" + aria-label on the gauge SVG
  - #7 Q34 SVG y-axis inversion — this is a visual bug in the mockup itself. The numbers say "cheaper" but the line
  visually slopes upward. Anyone reviewing the mockup would get the wrong impression
  - #2 One empty state example — showing one card in its empty state (e.g., Q8 Queue as "Queue is empty") proves the
  design handles zero-data gracefully. Mockups that only show the happy path lead to production UIs where empty states
  are an afterthought. Doesn't need to be every card — just one per section to set the pattern

  - #10 Q# card labels — already in the mockup and not in the spec. This one goes the other direction: the spec should
  catch up to the mockup

  Bottom line: 5 of the 9 gaps are purely runtime concerns and the mockup is correct to skip them. The 3 worth fixing
  are the SVG visual bug (#7), one empty state example (#2), and baseline ARIA on section headers + gauge (#1).
  Everything else is production work.
